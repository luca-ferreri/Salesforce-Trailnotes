# What is this repo?
A collection of real-world lessons, examples, and practical insights from our journey adopting Salesforce â€” covering everything from system integration (like Apache Solr and Federated Search) to configuration patterns, custom development, and process design. Born from an open-source background, this collaborative effort aims to bridge the gap between open-source thinking and the not always clear Salesforce documentation and ecosystem.
